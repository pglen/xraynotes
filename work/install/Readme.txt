		             XrayNotes Readme 


 Welcome to XrayNotes. We hope that you will enjoy your computing experience with this innovative, state of the art program.

 XrayNotes is an integrated suite of image annotation, DICOM viewer, 3-D image modeling, patient data processing and global patient data sharing applications.

 The copy of XrayNotes you have installed is a preview. It is functionally equivalent to the full version, with the exception of:

	o Contains new features for field testing purposes
	o Has no warranty pertaining to the compatibility of data it reads or creates

  While every care is taken to make a stable and robust and compatible product or put a preview please note and that knowledge that you are looking at the program that is in state of flux, in a state of evolution that will yield the most useful and most practical data processing system for the medical industry. 

 XrayNotes is a patient centered data processing system. It will act as a clearinghouse and container for all healing related data. At the heart of the medical data is the patient's demographical information. With the demographical of information as the root, event records are attached. Every single thing that happens to the patients during the course of healing is captured into a medical event. Example medical events could be patient appointment, surgery, laboratory test, or for that matter, anything that is related to the treatment and care of the patient.

 The medical event can have images, auxiliary data, text, annotations, x-rays, MRIs, or any other information form attached to it. Thus XrayNotes is a tool that can house a complete array of information pertaining to the process of serving the patient.

 Every patient and event is encoded with a long unique number. Because this unique number cannot be case back to the original patient, patient data and event data can be freely shared across unsecured network. This has the added advantage that medical data in its purest form is available for education, research and a host of other noble cause without endangering any individual's data.


 XrayNotes confirms to most major standards, like DICOM, HIPAA and DMED. In the course of creating XrayNotes we attempted to adhere to all standards and conventions, thus creating a suite of applications that may prototype a new standard in medical data processing. Most of the data formats, algorithms and fundamental user interface elements are published as open source, so XrayNotes promotes inter-institution inter-program data exchange.

  With an eye to the future, XrayNotes exposes significant functionality to scripting languages like Python and to industry-standard languages like C++, allowing programmatic interface to medical data, especially imaging. With the hope, that in the future image processing algorithms will advance to the point where diseases can be programmatically analyzed, bacteria in viruses can be programmatically recognized.

Thank you for trying a program, we hope you have as much fun using it as we had creating it,
