  This project is a visual editor and annotator for medical images.
  
  Suspended due to a lack of resources.
	
  Had to step back into VC 6.0 as porting became to time intensive.
    
  Visual C6 sources are in *_vc6. The stap back was needed as the newer compiler
needs fancy footwork on providing libraries for it. This was inconsistent of 
the original goal of simple deployment.
